    <content><![CDATA[<p>在前面的课程中，我们已经成功搭建了我们的blog，并将它放到了github通过域名进行访问，今天我们来学习一下如何用Markdown来写文章。</p>
<p>首先简要介绍一下什么是Markdown：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Markdown 是一种轻量级标记语言，它允许人们使用易读易写的纯文本格式编写文档。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 语言在 2004 由约翰·格鲁伯（英语：John Gruber）创建。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 编写的文档可以导出 HTML 、Word、图像、PDF、Epub 等多种格式的文档。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Markdown 编写的文档后缀为 <code>.md</code>,  <code>.markdown</code>。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Markdown标题"><a href="#1-Markdown标题" class="headerlink" title="1.Markdown标题"></a>1.Markdown标题</h3><p>我们使用<code>#</code>号来标记我们的标题,一共有六级标题,分别对应1到6个<code>#</code>号,如下</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># 一级标题</span><br><span class="line">## 二级标题</span><br><span class="line">### 三级标题</span><br><span class="line">#### 四级标题</span><br><span class="line">##### 五级标题</span><br><span class="line">###### 六级标题</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <title>my new year of 2020</title>
    <url>/2020/01/10/my-new-year-of-2020/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the year of 2020, I continue to study in Nanjing Foreign language school – BCA. As a new start, I would like to make a summary of my 2019 and hope to get something I can make a progression on. Moreover, I want to set up some goals for my future grade 11 and 12 study, which will help my university study as well. </p>
<p>First of all, I tried to improve my academic ability in 2019 as a high school student. I finish reading the book called taking side – the global issue and make mind maps for some articles I am interested in. I keep studying for TOEFL and maintain the GPA in a stable level. </p>
<p>What is more, I keep participating debate in NHSDLC, which is one of my favorite activities. What is exciting, I achieved the championship in the Nanjing tournament 2019 of NHSDLC and it is my pleasure to see the achievement with after so much effort. </p>
<p>In 2020, besides these things I always insist on, I will start the learning of AP and try to pass the test of TOEFL. This means I will try to adapt my ability to be close to university level as well, including my academic skill as researching, reading, writing and analysis. </p>
<p>I will alternate work with rest as well. I plan to watch some musical drama I like and travel some places I have never been to, which is always my pursuit. </p>

    <title>finish reading Animal Spirit</title>
    <url>/2020/03/19/finish-reading-Animal-Spirit/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Written by Akerlof and Shiller, this book talks about the “animal spirit” theory from Keynes, clarifying that the strong physiological force is impelling the economic market. Unlike the theory of rational man in economy, Keynes clarified that humans got an impulsion in investment pushing by the animal spirit. </p>
<p>Akerlof and Shiller reassert the necessity of an active government role in economic policymaking by recovering the idea of animal spirits, a term John Maynard Keynes used to describe the gloom and despondence that led to the Great Depression and the changing psychology that accompanied recovery. </p>
<p>This book mainly talks about macro economy in the view of psychological parts, analyzing how the Great Depression happened and the current macroeconomic policies. It is interesting to read this book during this period after <strong>*continuous stock melting *</strong>in American Stock Market in simply one month.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into two parts: </p>

    <title>python study</title>
    <url>/2020/03/19/python-study/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of the winter holiday in 2019, I started the study of python class. As a technique of data analysis, it is a brand new idea for a student like me who alwyas want to study art majors or economy to learn computer science about coding. However, as a summary or a feeling after several months’ study, I notice the meaning and importance of computer technology, not only for STEM major students but also for students like me, which is necessary to have a broad knowledge in diverse subjects. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8Do6TU.png" alt="8Do6TU.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DoRfJ.png" alt="8DoRfJ.png"></p>
<p>From the very first lesson about how to input simple codes to do some calculations: </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DohlR.png" alt="8DohlR.png"></p>
<p>To make some easy instructions from code (like how can a website ask some questions when we are creating accounts): </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8Do461.png" alt="8Do461.png"></p>

<p>and how to calculate the average scores and string some words. </p>
<p>Of courrse there is some difficulties and so many <strong><em>errors</em></strong> while coding:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DT839.png" alt=" "></p>
<p>However, it is always meaningful to learn how to use this code tool for future data analysis. It is hard to say I  totally master everything I have learned, but it always takes time to study. At the end of classes of winter holiday but the beginning of new study, I hope to make a summary for this semester.</p>

    <title>numpy study begin</title>
    <url>/2020/03/19/numpy-study-begin/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After finishing the initial learning of code about python in winter holiday, I start to learn numpy in order to help future data analysis while doing project. Numpy is a computer tool which can create arrays, get single elements from arrays, stitch and split arrays and much more. Compared with simple codes I learned before, it is much complicated to write with Numpy. </p>
<p>However, <em>practice makes perfect</em>. Suggested by our teacher who can be an expert in coding, he clarifies that skills of coding can be practiced through muscle memory. </p>
<p>Here comes our firsst lesson: </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8D7aMn.png" alt="8D7aMn.png"></p>
<p>what comes after is much more comlicated data analysis. </p>
<p>What impressed me again at class is a statement from our teacher. He clarified the necessity of computer analysis again as he made a comparison between this and excel. He mentioned that Excel may go crush when there are thousands of sets of data, but computer can be used for the period of <strong><em>Big Data</em></strong>. The use for evidences and data in any fields’ research is inevitable. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8D77Je.png" alt="8D77Je.png"></p>
<p>This is an visible gram of  a 2-D continuous function:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DH9Jg.png" alt="8DH9Jg.png"></p>
<p>We can also make a division of data extent: </p>

<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DHALq.png" alt="8DHALq.png"></p>
<p>Frankly, everthing about code and numpy is complicated for me. I am trying my best to memorize these codes and try to utilize in the future cases that i may meet. </p>

    <title>2018 to 2019 Debate summary</title>
    <url>/2020/03/19/2018-to-2019-Debate-summary/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is a little bit sentimental to talk in this way, but I have to admit that debate is the activity that I never regret to devote time in and I will continue to spend time on it. </p>
<p>Since the summer of 2018, debate almost symbols the development in the first half of my senior high school life. There are other activities like Business competitions and forum or volunteer activities I have been to, while debate reflects the growth of mine in different scales: speech, essay writing, critical thinking and  cooperation. It sounds a cliche to talk about these skills, but debate is always what I am longed to. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DHvc9.png" alt="8DHvc9.png"></p>
<p>I have been through three seasons of American Debate Tournament, from the 2018 Fall, 2019 spring to 2019 Fall. The progress I achieved makes excited for the first time even though I am the sort of students that never get satisfied. I still feel so proud about the progression I made. </p>
<p>In the tournament of 2018 Fall, about the resolution of “In the US criminal justice system, only people convicted of violent crimes should be sentenced to prison.”</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8Dbl4S" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8Dbl4S.png" alt="8Dbl4S.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DbMAf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DbMAf.png" alt="8DbMAf.png"></a></p>
<p>I finished this tournament with two Octofinal in Nanjing and Hefei, which is a not very brilliant outcome but welcomed new debaters. </p>
<p>Then, I partnered with my friend to join the 2019 Spring tournament. We debate on the resolution of “ Countries should prioritize climate change adaptation over mitigation.” </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8Dbr34.png" alt="8Dbr34.png"></p>
<p>It is hard to summary the process of preparing and how we discuss for our cases and blocks, as it is a long story. We got a finalist in Nanjing which is a great progress. </p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DbHKA.jpg" alt="8DbHKA.jpg"></p>
<p>For the third time I joined in debate in last semester, at the beginning of my Grade 11, we started a resolution on <em>Sates should eliminate their arsenals of nuclear weapons.</em> “</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DbXUf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DbXUf.png" alt="8DbXUf.png"></a></p>
<p>My partner and I devoted most of our weekends in preparing for it and we made a change in cases and blocks for five different versions. </p>
<p>We are delighted to get the championship in Nanjing for the very first time. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DqkV0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DqkV0.jpg" alt="8DqkV0.jpg"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DqAaV" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/19/8DqAaV.png" alt="8DqAaV.png"></a></p>
<p>I  will not stop on the way of debate ativity and this is the summary for the first half of debate experience. 2020 is coming and a new tournament starts, I am  excited to see what will happen and meet more friends. </p>

<p>It was freezing to wait in the forest, on the mountain and near the seaside for the aurora borealis for continuous four days. Every day we waited outside for about four hours just for waiting for it. </p>
<p>Small tips: The appear of aurora borealis is related with the activity of sunspot, and cameras are more sensitive to catch those activities compared with humans’ eyes. So, actually it is always more clear to see it in the camera than see it with our eyes directly. It seems to be opposite to our normal opinions as we think it is “always” clear to see something directly instead of photos. </p>

    <title>Case Study of Franchise Stores</title>
    <url>/2020/04/08/Case-Study-of-Franchise-Stores/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For thr case study about Subway, we try to learn the business model of Franchise shops and its pros and cons. We also learned the difference between the franchise stores and chain stores. </p>
<p>After class, I worked on the case of KFC and how this brand experienced its own expansion at China. Then, I finished a short essay and received some comments from our teacher. （Essay showing below)</p>
<p><strong><em>Question One: Ways of KFC expanding with Pros and Cons in China whole title</em></strong></p>
<p>We can almost see the stores of Kentucky Fried Chicken everywhere around world, but how can a brand expand to such a scale? KFC, as a subsidiary operated by the Yum! China division, was the first western food company in China. Through franchising and enlarge the scale of chain store, KFC occupies a large portion of the fast food market in China [This statement should be supported by references]. Franchising, as a theory that “provides firm-specific and location-specific conditions when a firm may choose the franchising business model” (Mishra, 2, 2017), [Need to include the year published in the citation] can help an impressive brand increasing its influence in the market. Compared with franchising, chain store is a similar method to expand brand’s market, but there is a slight distinction. [Need to explain the distinction between franchises and chain stores] After all, the business models of franchising and chain stores have both advantages and disadvantages reflecting from its management. </p>
<p>​    Initially, franchising is a strategy under investment of the brand and use the effect of brand advertising in order to a get a higher profit with least labor-saving management. Considering the four factors as capital, land, labor and enterprise, franchising tries to “employ the enterprise power” to help them manage the store everywhere. [Need a reference to support the explanation of franchising] The individual owner can operate the store of their own and get the profit after handing in franchising fee to the brand company. Since 1987 when KFC opened the first outlet in Beijing, this company has become a successful example of expanding in different regions and be localized. [Need a reference to support the discussion on KFC growth] By 2015, KFC has over 5003 outlets in China with an absolute trend of increasing in the future. Through this way, KFC develops the flexibility in management and enterprise, and allocate management resources wisely so as to get profit as much as possible with a limited enterprise energy. </p>
<p>​    Furthermore, chain stores have a similar business model with franchising. Through opening outlets as the methods of franchising, many brands increase its competitiveness. However, KFC did not choose this way while they entered different markets. What is different with franchising, chain store is not employing a power of enterprise [Need to explain what is meant by “power of enterprise”] but directly opens and operates different stores through parent company instead of the individual owner. Many convenience stores may choose the model of chain stores like FamilyMart. [Need to explain the principles of chain stores, and support the discussion with references] Nevertheless, unlike the management of restaurant as KFC, the operation of a convenience store seems easier which is suitable for directly operating. [This sentence appears to provide an opinion, which may be appropriate, if it is supported by suitable references] need to get more reference </p>
<p>​    Last but not least, both of these business models have some advantages and disadvantages. For franchising, it is born with a brand recognizing during the market competition as “branding is a very powerful component” (Barim, [Year of publication?] 517). Moreover, with the influence from the parent company, franchising seems to have a lower risk of failure for individual investment. However, it requires an initial cost if investors would like to open a franchising store, and, taking the example of KFC, there are always strict rules from the brand for individual owner to open and operate a store. This is how this brand protect the fame of brand. Moving to chain stores’ model, there is no such a fee like initial cost. However, the cost of operating directly by the brand seems to a fortune. [Again, need to support statements such as this with references]</p>
<p>[Whilst a few of the advantages of franchises and chain stores have been considered. No attempt has been made to consider disadvantages]</p>
<p>​    After all, various business models, like franchising and chain stores, have both pros and cons. KFC can be served as an outstanding example for entering the Chinese market using franchising and opening outlets. As soon as the individual owners want the positive influence from a well-known brand, they always have to pay something. (we open a Franchise still need to pay a fortune to clarify) Brand influence is one of the reasons for some investors’ preference in franchising, while chain store can also be the optimal choice for some companies in directly operating. </p>

    <title>In memory of Grade 10: Model Canadian election</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/In-memory-of-Grade-10-Model-Canadian-election/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For the very first year in my senior high, I experienced a lot of interesting activities, and for this passage I would like to talk about an activity in my social study class. </p>
<p>In grade ten, our teacher introduced some changes in the history of Canadian government the structures and talked about the current election process in Canada. In order to make us get the real experience for such political structure, our class was divided into several parties and hold a model election: from the propaganda video to the real speech and debates between candidate, and finally votes from other grades.</p>
<p>I was divided into the Liberal party for a model Canadian election ion for social study class. there are several roles like video making, backup group and the candidate who is required to make the speech and lead the whole team. I was willing to become the candidate of my team based on my debate and speech skills, and would like to voice out to persuade others. </p>
<p>I firstly designed a poster with my teammates in order to show a direct propaganda with our slogan. And then, I made a speech based on some heated topic in Canada like how to improve daily income of middle class, what is the effect of the legalization for marijuana in both economic and social aspects and the influence in economy and environment of pipeline constructions in Edmonton. </p>
<p>Finally, I won the election with the most seats successfully, with the progress of my whole team. </p>

    <title>In memory of Grade 11: STEM Fair</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/In-memory-of-Grade-11-STEM-Fair/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In memory of Grade 11: STEM Fair </p>
<p>in the second year of my senior high school life, I experienced a fantastic activity which is science fair. Students can make teams by themselves within three people, and select a topic whatever they like in science field such as biology, chemistry, maths or physic. We will select a topic and prepare an abstract about our topic: what is the topic about, what is goal, how the experiment is going on and our timeline. We are required to make a PPT to make a speech to our sponsor teacher, and finally we need to prepare a board to make an introduction to all the students in the school on the playground. </p>
<p>Our team decided to make a PCR test on milk powder to make sure if these brands have made the milk transgene or not. The PCR machine is called Polymerase Chain Reaction, which can multiply the tiny gene piece to make it easier to see, and help the tester to compare to the transgene chain. The gene we are going to test (find) is called jumping gene, which is brought by the trans genetic process. We prepare 10 brands, 5 domestic brands and five international brands. </p>

    <title>Eight Valleys Business Project</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/Eight-Valleys-Business-Project/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In this summer, I joined the eight valleys business project, which can help me understand how to make a program with my team in order to satisfy the new selling model: new retail on the brand YOHO, and finally provide this brand with a better new retail plan: including how we can design the pop-up shop, what we can </p>
<p>As a member of data analysis department in my team, I need to provide a flaw cart based on the data of CPA, which is a number to calculate the cost and efficiency of an advertisement of this brand. My team mate Nico analyzed the downloading information of YOHO’s app. For me, I calculate the efficiency of guidance of the consumers from offline (pop-up shops) to online (buy on app or online shops) based on CPA and other equations, in order to persuade the YOHO brand with the efficiency and larger profit through the new retail model. </p>

    <title>ACAI animal crossing artificial intelligence abstract</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/ACAI-animal-crossing-artificial-intelligence-abstract/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the special period of Covid-19, I joined a special online activity in Animal Crossing (a popular game on switch) which is a meeting about Artificial Intelligence discussion, and people all around the world can directly talk online, on zoom or on animal crossing. The holder will select 16 projects all over the world and they can make a presentation on animal crossing about their project. </p>
<p>My team mates and I decide to do an interesting project, and I wrote an abstract for our project: </p>
<p>Reinforcement learning called Deep Q Network is a learning algorithm that can train the NNs without Dataset. It has a prospect to becoming an efficient method to require the machines of autonomous learning ability to finish a specific task. When NNs is being trained, DQN is able to automatically adjust parameters and record the optimum data for further trainings. </p>
<p>In 2013, Tencent, a Chinese privately operated IT company, has introduced a mini-game called Aircraft War on WeChat, and this game has been popular for a while at that time. This dissertation considers the scenario in mini-game as a sample and examines the effectiveness of Deep Q Network while training agents to automatically play this game. In other words, the dissertation will discuss if DQN can effectively train an agent to automatically get a high mark in this game. The dissertation additionally defines distinctive observations and compares agents’ training process and performance situations under diverse observations. </p>
<p>The anterior researchers have frequently tested in electronic games to figure out the availability of different reinforcement learning algorithms. As senior high school students, we are trying to establish a networking platform to promote communications between the players of Aircrafts War all over the world. As soon as players enter the platform, they can experience Aircraft War under the DQN handler. Players are also able to directly change code parameters of DQN to control the agent so as to enhance their participations of this learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Key Words：AI Game, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q Network</p>
<p>We then sent this abstract to the holder and luckily, we are selected to make presentation as one of 16. </p>

    <title>Personal Statement class 1</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/Personal-Statement-class-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Personally, I value experience and diversity. My middle school was a traditional Chinese school in another city but not in Nanjing, and everything we have is just writing assignments and tests every week, month, season and semester with rankings. I rarely talked or discussed questions with my classmates but simply solved questions myself and had lessons. There were about 960 students in my grade and the only I need to do was keeping my ranking in top thirty. This was the only goal for my and the requirement from my parents and teachers. The subjects included in school are about only maths, science and mandarin, but we will have no chance to learn about the difference between majors. I knew this system in China is reasonable sometimes as china have one of the largest populations in the world, so test is one effective way for competition. However, if I continue this style in senior high, I would know nothing about what I am going to learn in university but just focus on rankings or scores. And after getting the grade for enter-university examination in China, I would only blindly fill one of the hot majors on my college application without any preparation. If I do so, I am not responsible for my future as I do not want to decide my future when I know nothing about it. </p>
<p>At this time, when I was in grade 8, I went for a trip in Britain with my parents, and I visited some famous colleges there. When I was walking on the street of Cambridge, I saw some students reading some books and discussing. I think this is something I have never experienced before and I got addicted to this academic environment. Then, the tour guide mentioned her application experience for UK, and I knew that through doing some activities and writing the personal statement, we could know about ourselves better and help us make further understanding in what major we really loved. This was also the standard for offering by many universities: understand my major and show the passion to universities, and tell administrator why I am suitable for this major or college as I understand it. And suddenly I knew that this what I want: preparation for my major and be responsible for myself through activity and investigation, so I decided to try some international courses and desire to study in the UK. </p>
<p>Moving on, the reasons why I choose business major are for several reasons: inspiration from my mother and my own personality. I am always a talkative and persuasive girl. When become a senior high student, I devote myself into debate and get championship. The technique for debating is about persuading the judges to trust your opinion, and this is how I think I am equipped with communication skills. I also joined a model election for social study class when I was in grade 10. In that activity, the whole class were divided in to several parties in Canada and stimulate a professional election process with voting by other grades. I became the candidate of Liberal party and won the election with highest tally with my teammates. And I think leadership can be one of important element for business major in decision making, and I loved the multidisciplined experience during the election. Furthermore, my mom is a business woman and she runs for a company since I am young. She often talks with how should I interact with others and the importance of insistence. She is always my goal and model and that is one of the reason I want to be close to her, so I choose business. </p>

    <title>Personal Statement class 3</title>
    <url>/2020/08/17/Personal-Statement-class-3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At first, I preferred some art majors like sociology or history, as social activities could be reflected from history. However, in a social study class, my teacher introduced me about the Great Depression from the movie the Great Gatsby, and I noticed that most of the historical events happened due to some economic changes, including changes about economic policies and structures. Human activities would also be affected by economy, so I decided to learn about some economic majors, and I went to read the books <em>Animal Spirit,</em> which introduces the social activities in the perspective of macroeconomy and the modern liberalism. As a result, I found out that economy can be the basis for human activity and I decided to learn further about this field. </p>
<p>I started to learn AP subjects about economics. After taking the AP tests for both micro and macro economies, I learned some basic economy knowledge from principles of Economies. Later on, I read some books and articles in order to have a further understanding in Economies and then joined some activities for utilizing my knowledges in some practical economic environment. I read more books which are called Animal Spirit and a series of books called Taking Sides: Business, Economy and global problems. The Taking Sides introduce several topics like global problems and stand on two perspectives: pros and cons to provide an overall understanding towards on topic.</p>
<p>With further investigation, I found that the economic department can be divided into several majors: Finance, Economy, Accounting and Management. I searched the curriculum from the universities about these majors, and deem that Management would be perfectly suitable for me. </p>
<p>I am interested in debate which can develop my critical thinking. I can stand on both pro and con of the same topics and make a resolution on each of them, which can provide me with an overall understanding and help me persuade others. I won the championship in Nanjing tournament of NHSDLC. Furthermore, I took part in the HEIghten critical thinking competition and get intermediate level. </p>
<p>I am also addicted to a multidisciplined environment and willing to negotiate with others in a team as a whole. In grade ten, I was in the Liberal party for a model Canadian election for social study class. I decided to be the candidate of my team based on my debate and speech skills and would like to voice out to persuade others. I made a speech based on some heated topic in Canada like how to improve daily income of middle class, what is the effect of the legalization for marijuana in both economic and social aspects and the influence in economy and environment of pipeline constructions in Edmonton. After all, with the cooperation and propaganda with my teammates, I won the model election with most seats. In the summer of my grade ten, I joined the MicroBiz business competition in order to strengthen my communicative competence. </p>
<p>I participated some school activities and take charge of Tutor Club as the club leader, and tried to participate STEM fair and made a presentation about PCR testing on milk powder for a diversity in school subjects. </p>
<p>I also took in part in data analysis project and build on my personal GitHub based on my Python skills. With data analysis skills, I practiced several codes through learning and posted them on my GitHub. As the coordinator, I joined ACAI 2020 (animal crossing artificial intelligence) program with two of my classmates. Our team investigated a program with AI self-learning and use it in a real game. In 2013, Tencent, a Chinese privately operated IT company, has introduced a mini-game called Aircraft War on WeChat, and this game has been popular for a while at that time. This dissertation considers the scenario in mini-game as a sample and examines the effectiveness of Deep Q Network while training agents to automatically play this game. Luckily, we are chosen as one of sixteen top projects all over the world, and made the presentation in front of everyone to introduce our projects.</p>
